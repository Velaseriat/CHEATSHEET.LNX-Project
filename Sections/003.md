### Data Streams & Redirection

A data stream is something that transfers data into and out of the shell when something is executing.

There are three data streams:
- `stdin`: "Standard Input." Accepts text as input by default
- `stdout`: "Standard Output." Terminal is the output by default
- `stderr`: "Standard Error." Error is directed the same way as `stdout`, but is nonetheless separated.

`>` and `>>` (and `<` and `<<`) operators redirect input and output from the terminal to a file.

- `>` (or `1>`) will redirect the standard output (`stdout`) to a file specified to the right side.
- Replacing `>` with `>>` or `<` with `<<` will force the shell to _append to the end_ instead of _clear and rewrite from the beginning_.
- `<` (or `0<`) will redirect the standard input so that the input comes from a file.
- `2>` will redirect the standard error like it does with standard output.

## `/dev/null`

This is a special file that you can only write to.
The output is discarded, so it can be called the Linux Waste Bin.

## Variables

Variables can be defined as follows:

```bash
$ MYVAR="Hi, there"
$ echo $MYVAR
Hi, there
```

You must NOT separate `MYVAR=` into `MYVAR =`.

The `export` marks a variable to be inherited by all programs and shells that have been launched from the current shell.
