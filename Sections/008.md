### Identity

A file or directory is owned by some user and groups that which the user belongs.

That file or directory can also be accessed by anyone if made possible.

### Permissions

- `r` (read): For files, retrieving contents. For directories, making a listing.
- `w` (write): For files, changing contents. For directories, modify listing.
- `x` (execute): For files, executing. For directories, making it current directory.

### Permission delineation

1. User
2. Group
3. Everyone else

### Code

1. `r`
2. `w`
3. `x`
