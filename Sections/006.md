## Looping

- `while`
- `for`
- `until`
- `select` (interactive!)

### `while`

```bash
while command
do
    STATEMENT
done
```

### `for`

```bash
for var in words...
do
    STATEMENT
done
```

I can't find the evidence that infinite for loops can be created with empty expressions.

### `until`

`until` is like a `while` loop but the it executes until the command turns true.

### `select`

Simple menu system.

Not used really.

Syntax is like `for`.
