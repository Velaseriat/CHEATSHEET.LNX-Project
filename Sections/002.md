## Interrogating, Manipulating and Sharing Files

First, using aliases

- `alias`: Creates an alias
- `unalias`: Unlists an alias
- How to permanently store aliases

Second, files
- `touch`
- `rm`
- `find`
- `file`
- `stat`
- `wc`
- `tar`

### `touch`

```bash
touch [OPTION]... FILE...
```

### `rm`

```bash
rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

### `find`

used to find files or directories and perform subsequent operations on them.

You can search by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner, and permissions.

```bash
find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]
```

### `file`

used to determine the type of file based 3 sets of test: filesystem, magic, and language test.

```bash
file [OPTION]... FILE ...
```

### `stat`

```bash
stat [OPTION]... FILE ...
```

### `wc`

Print newline, word and byte counts for each file

```bash
wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

Example 1:

```bash
$ cat treasure.txt
This is my treasure.
I love myself.

# file includes last newline
$ wc treasure.txt
 3  7 37 treasure.txt

# 3 line breaks ('\n')
# 7 words ("this" "is" "my" "treasure." "I" "love" and "myself.")
# 37 bytes

$ cat nice.txt
You are such a nice person!
# no end newline
$ wc treasure.txt nice.txt
 3  7 37 treasure.txt
 1  6 28 nice.txt
 4 13 65 total
```

#### Important options

- `c` (`bytes`) byte counts
- `l` (`lines`) newline counts
- `w` (`words`) word counts

Example:

```bash
$ wc -cl treasure.txt
 3 37 treasure.txt
```

#### Ordering of columns

The columns are separated by 1 or more spaces.

The columns are always ordered in the same way (i.e. newlines -> words -> bytes).

If more than one option is provided, then only selected columns are displayed.

### `tar`

- `tar xvf ARCHIVE` extracts the archive
- `tar cvf ARCHIVE FILES` creates the archive out of the files
