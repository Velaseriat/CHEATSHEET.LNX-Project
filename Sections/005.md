## Exit status, arguments and conditional control

### Exit Status

Every program, upon exit, returns with a code indicating how well the job was done.
The code is an integer from [0, 255].

- `0`: good
- `1`: error during expansion or redirection; other reasons
- `2`: incorrect usage
- `126`: command found but not executable
- `127`: command not found

### Arguments & Other Innate Variables

- `$?`: Exit code of last command
- `$0`: Name of command
- `$1`: First argument
- `$2`: Second argument
- `$n`: n-th argument
- `$#`: number of arguments
- `$*`: all arguments double quoted
- `$@`: all arguments individually double quoted
- `$$`: process number of current shell
- `$!`: process number of last background command

#### Boolean

- `&&`
- `||`

#### If, If-Else and If-Elif-Else

```bash
if [ CONDITION ]
then
    STATEMENTS
fi

if [ CONDITION ]
then
    STATEMENTS
else
    STATEMENTS
fi

if [ CONDITION ]
then
    STATEMENTS
elif [ CONDITION ]
    STATEMENTS
else
    STATEMENTS
fi
```

#### Case (also called switch)

```bash
# in "...', use value (like "$VAR" or $MY_NUMBER)
case ... in
    PATTERN1 ) STATEMENTS ;;
    PATTERN2 ) STATEMENTS
        ;;
esac
```

#### `test` or `[ ]`

`[` is an alias for `test` so they can be interchanged.

But `[` must be enclosed with `]`.

- `!`: NOT
- `n`: String length > 0
- `z`: String length = 0
- `=`: Strings are equal
- `!=`: Strings are not equal
- `eq`: Integers are equal
- `gt`: Left-side is greater than right-side
- `lt`: Left-side is less than right-side
- `d`: File exists and is a directory
- `e`: File exists
- `r`: File has read perm
- `s`: File size > 0
- `w`: File has write perm
- `x`: File has execute perm

#### `true`, `false`

- `true`: exits 0
- `false`: exits 1
